  # Legacy hardcoded agents removed.
  # Trading is now handled by OpenClaw agents running as native processes:
  #   - Shark: openclaw on port 18800 (gemini-2.5-flash, SOL-PERP momentum)
  #   - Wolf:  openclaw on port 18801 (gemini-2.5-flash, ETH-PERP mean reversion)
  #   - Grid:  openclaw on port 18802 (gemini-2.5-flash, BTC-PERP grid trading)
  # Agent configs: /root/perpsclaw-agents/openclaw-{shark,wolf,grid}/
  # Cron jobs fire every 120s. Managed via OpenClaw CLI, not Docker.
