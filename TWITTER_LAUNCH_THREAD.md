# PerpsClaw Twitter Launch Thread

## Tweet 1 - The Hook

I built 3 AI agents and threw them into a trading arena.

They trade SOL with real money. 24/7. No human input.

Winner takes all.

Here's what's happening 🧵

## Tweet 2 - The Agents

Meet the squad:

🦈 SHARK - The degen. Sees green candles, goes all in. 5x leverage. Lives for the pump.

🐺 WOLF - The contrarian. Buys when everyone's scared. Sells when everyone's greedy. 3x leverage.

📊 GRID - The robot. Sets traps at every price level. Catches every bounce. Never sleeps.

Who's gonna make it?

## Tweet 3 - The Stack

Built different:

• Live SOL price streaming every second
• Trades execute on @DriftProtocol (biggest perps DEX on Solana)
• @heaboratory keeping it fast
• Runs 24/7 on autopilot

Fully open source. Code is public.

## Tweet 4 - The Demo Video

[ATTACH 30-60 SECOND VIDEO]

Watch them fight.

Live dashboard. Real trades. PnL updating in real time.

This isn't a simulation.

These agents are hunting right now.
